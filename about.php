            <h2>The Heart of Iloilo’s Rattan Tradition</h2>
            <p>
                Iloilo has long been a hub for skilled artisans who weave rattan into functional,
                durable, and beautiful creations. In small towns and coastal communities, weaving has
                been passed down through generations — not just as a livelihood, but as a cultural
                expression that shapes local identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rattan, locally sourced and highly sustainable, thrives in the Philippine environment.
                Its flexibility and strength allow Ilonggo artisans to craft baskets, bags, trays,
                chairs, and intricate home décor. Each piece reflects hours of handwork,
                craftsmanship, and deep respect for materials from the land.

            <h2>More Than Craft — A Living Heritage</h2>
            <p>
                For many families in Iloilo, rattan weaving connects them to their ancestors. Patterns
                and techniques are often inherited, taught informally within households or community
                workshops. These designs carry stories — of festivals, trade routes, resilience, and
                local pride.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Philippines, known worldwide for its weaving traditions, recognizes rattan craft
                as part of our broader cultural tapestry. It represents ingenuity: transforming natural
                fibers into pieces that serve everyday life, from traditional markets to modern homes.

            <h2>Supporting Local Communities</h2>
            <p>
                When people choose locally crafted rattan products, they support Ilonggo artisans
                directly. This sustains weaving traditions, preserves the livelihood of rural
                communities, and promotes eco-friendly production.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rattan craft embodies Filipino values: resourcefulness, beauty, and strong community
                roots. Every woven piece is more than an object — it is the story of the hands that
                made it.
